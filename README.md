## ðŸ”§ The `measure_time` Decorator

The core `measure_time` decorator is designed to measure the execution time of any function:

```python
@measure_time
def my_function(n):
    # function implementation
    return result

# Usage
result, execution_time = my_function(100)
print(f"Result: {result}, Time: {execution_time:.6f} seconds")
```

## ðŸ“Š Time Complexities Demonstrated

### O(1) - Constant Time

- __Function__: `constant_time_function(n)`
- **Behavior**: Performs simple arithmetic operations
- **Characteristic**: Runtime stays approximately the same regardless of input size

### O(n) - Linear Time

- __Function__: `linear_time_function(n)`
- **Behavior**: Sums numbers from 1 to n using a loop
- **Characteristic**: Runtime grows linearly with input size

### O(nÂ²) - Quadratic Time

- __Function__: `quadratic_time_function(n)`
- **Behavior**: Uses nested loops to perform operations
- **Characteristic**: Runtime grows quadratically with input size

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Run the complete solution:

```bash
python complete_solution.py
```

Or try individual examples:

```bash
# Simple decorator demonstration
python decorator_example.py

# Detailed analysis with multiple plots
python time_complexity_analysis.py

# Advanced algorithm examples
python advanced_examples.py

# Binary search implementation
python binary_search_complete.py
```

## ðŸ§ª Running the Analysis

1. Run the simple decorator example:

```bash
python decorator_example.py
```

2. Run the full time complexity analysis:

```bash
python time_complexity_analysis.py
```

This will:

- Test each function with different input sizes
- Measure execution times
- Generate plots showing the relationship between input size and runtime
- Save a detailed analysis plot as `time_complexity_analysis.png`

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Results

- **O(1)**: Flat line (constant time)
- **O(n)**: Straight diagonal line (linear growth)
- **O(nÂ²)**: Curved line that grows rapidly (quadratic growth)

The log-log plot makes it easier to see the different growth rates on the same scale.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib >= 3.5.0
- numpy >= 1.21.0
- pandas (for quizzes)
- plotly (for quizzes)

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas plotly
```
